        "content": "Based on the provided context, dams impact our environment in several ways. They store water in large reservoirs, which helps people by providing water for drinking, irrigation, and electricity. However, building dams also causes flooding of land that was once home to animals and people, forcing many to leave their homes and relocate. Additionally, dams can affect forests, animals, and local communities near the river. The construction of dams can lead to environmental changes such as flooding large areas and disrupting ecosystems. \n\nTo help protect the environment, communities can take steps to keep water bodies clean by stopping waste from entering the water, as mentioned in the context: \"people are working to stop waste from going into my water.\" Efforts like the Namami Gange programme aim to keep rivers healthy for people, fish, and birds. \n\nAs a community, we can also be mindful of water usage, avoid wasting water, and participate in activities that prevent pollution of rivers and lakes. These actions help maintain the health of our water resources and reduce the negative impacts of dams on the environment. [Sources: eeev102.pdf]"
