As mentioned in the context, \"people are working to stop waste from going into my water,\" and programs like the *Namami Gange* aim to keep rivers clean.\n- **Water Treatment Plants:** Set up sewage and industrial waste treatment facilities to ensure that pollutants are removed before water is released into the river.\n- **Community Awareness:** Educate residents about the importance of not littering and using eco-friendly products to reduce pollution.\n- **Regular Cleaning Drives:** Organize community efforts to clean the riverbanks and remove trash.\n\n**Preventing Floods During Heavy Rains:**\n- **Building Dams and Embankments:** Construct dams and levees to control water flow and prevent overflow, similar to the *Hirakud dam* in Odisha, which is one of the longest earthen dams in the world.\n- **Proper Drainage Systems:** Design effective drainage channels to direct excess water away from populated areas.\n- **Floodplain Management:** Avoid building houses in flood-prone areas and create green zones that can absorb excess water.\n- **Early Warning Systems:** Use weather forecasting and alerts to warn residents about potential floods so they can evacuate in time.\n\n**Additional Ideas:**\n- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Collect rainwater to reduce runoff and ease pressure on the river.\n- **Urban Planning:** Ensure that city development includes green spaces and permeable surfaces to absorb rainwater and reduce flooding.\n\nWould you like more specific examples or details on any of these ideas?

These initiatives aim to make the river healthy for people, fish, and birds, reflecting a commitment to river conservation.\n\n2. **Mumbai, India** – The city has developed extensive **stormwater drainage systems** and flood management infrastructure to prevent urban flooding during heavy rains. Additionally, efforts are underway to reduce pollution in the Mithi River by cleaning and maintaining its banks and water quality.\n\n3. **Singapore** – Known for its advanced urban planning, Singapore has implemented **integrated flood management systems**, including the construction of **reservoirs, canals, and green infrastructure** like parks and wetlands that absorb excess rainwater. These measures help prevent flooding and keep waterways clean.\n\n4. **The Netherlands** – Although not in India, the Netherlands is renowned for its **innovative flood control systems**, such as **dikes, surge barriers, and water pumps**, which protect cities like Rotterdam from flooding.

While the provided context does not give specific examples of cities ensuring a continuous water supply or facilitating fish migration, it does highlight some important principles and considerations related to these issues.\n\n**Ensuring There Is Enough Water in the River All Year:**\n- Cities and regions often plan their water management by building infrastructure like dams, which store water during the rainy season for use during dry periods. The context mentions that \"there are more than 900 dams that store my water so people can use it even during dry seasons,\" indicating that dams play a crucial role in maintaining water availability throughout the year.\n- Planning for sustainable water use involves managing water resources carefully, especially during summers, to ensure that there is always enough water for everyone. This can include regulating water extraction, promoting water conservation, and developing alternative sources like rainwater harvesting.\n\n**Helping Fish Migrate:**\n- Fish migration, such as that of the hilsa (ilish), is a natural process where fish travel from the sea into rivers to lay eggs. To support this, cities and environmental agencies can create fish-friendly structures like fish ladders or passages around dams, allowing fish to bypass obstacles and continue their migration.\n- Although the context does not specify particular examples, it emphasizes the importance of understanding natural migration patterns and designing infrastructure that supports these processes.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Cities ensure a steady water supply by constructing dams to store water and managing its use wisely.\n- To help fish migrate, they can build structures like fish ladders that enable fish to navigate past dams and other barriers.\n\nIf you'd like specific examples of cities implementing these measures or more detailed strategies, please let me know!
