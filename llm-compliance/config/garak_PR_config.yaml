# Goal: PR-gate subset (fast + deterministic-ish)

run:
  # Hard cap so PR gate stays fast
  max_probes: 3
  # Optional: if your garak build supports it, keep runs bounded
  timeout: 600
  # Soft cap on prompts per probe (may be ignored by some probes)
  soft_probe_prompt_cap: 5
  # Keep PR deterministic(ish)
  generations: 1
  temperature: 0
  # Keep small to reduce cost/time + reduce chance of leaking long content
  max_tokens: 400

#
# Keep detectors minimal for speed (optional; depends on your workflow)
# If you don’t rely on detectors here, you can omit this block.
