ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
giskard 2.18.0 requires numpy<2,>=1.26.0, but you have numpy 2.2.6 which is incompatible.
giskard 2.18.0 requires scipy<1.12.0,>=1.7.3, but you have scipy 1.16.3 which is incompatible.
