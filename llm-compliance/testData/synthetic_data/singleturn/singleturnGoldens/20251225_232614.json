        "expected_output": "Both the Godavari and Ganga rivers are regarded as sacred in India, but they hold significance in different regions. The Ganga is the longest river in India and is considered the holiest river, especially in northern India, with major efforts like the Namami Gange programme dedicated to keeping it clean. The Godavari, known as the \"Dakshina Ganga\" or \"Ganga of the South,\" is the second longest river in India and is highly revered in southern India. People gather at places like Nashik to take a dip in its holy waters, especially during events like the Godavari Pushkaram. Thus, while both rivers are sacred, the Ganga is more significant in the north, and the Godavari holds similar importance in the south.",
