Its name is inspired by the British comedy show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it a versatile choice for various types of projects. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management.\n\nThe language's syntax emphasizes clarity and simplicity, primarily achieved through significant indentation, which enhances code readability. Python's extensive standard library and broad ecosystem support a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing and machine learning.\n\nHistorically, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major transition to Python 3.0 occurred in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions. Since then, the Python community has continued to develop and improve the language, with current support focusing on Python 3.10 through 3.14 as of 2025. The latest stable release is Python 3.14.0, which continues to receive bug fixes and security updates.\n\nPython has gained widespread popularity, especially in the machine learning community, and has consistently ranked among the top programming languages in the TIOBE index since 2003.
