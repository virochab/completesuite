Developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes clear and concise code through features like significant indentation, which enhances readability and developer productivity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n\nPython is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed directly without prior compilation, and it is dynamically typed, allowing for flexible variable management. Its extensive standard library and broad ecosystem have contributed to its popularity across various domains, especially in machine learning, data analysis, web development, and automation.\n\nThe language has undergone significant evolution over the years. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 with new features such as list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major transition to Python 3.0 in 2008 introduced many backward-incompatible changes to improve the language's consistency and future-proofing. Since then, the Python community has continued to develop and support newer versions, with the latest stable release as of October 2025 being Python 3.14.0.\n\nPython's design philosophy prioritizes code readability and developer efficiency, which has helped it maintain a top position in popularity rankings, such as the TIOBE Index.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.\n\nAI encompasses a wide range of applications and subfields. High-profile examples include advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, and generative tools for creating art and language content. Many AI applications are so integrated into daily life that they are often not labeled explicitly as AI once they become common and useful.\n\nThe field has evolved through various phases of optimism and setbacks, known as AI winters, but significant progress has been made since the 2010s, especially with the advent of deep learning and neural networks. Recent advancements, particularly in generative AI, have led to rapid growth and new ethical considerations regarding safety and societal impact.\n\nAI research includes goals such as learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, and perception. Techniques used range from search algorithms and mathematical optimization to neural networks and statistical methods, drawing insights from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and other disciplines.\n\nA major goal within AI research is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems capable of understanding, learning, and performing virtually any cognitive task at human or superhuman levels. AGI would possess broad, adaptable intelligence similar to humans, as opposed to narrow AI, which is specialized for specific tasks. The pursuit of AGI is a focus for many leading tech companies and researchers, and it remains a significant topic in science fiction and future studies.\n\nIn summary, AI is a broad and dynamic field dedicated to creating intelligent systems that can perform complex tasks, with ongoing research aiming toward increasingly advanced and potentially autonomous forms of intelligence.", "tools_called": [{"name": "wikipedia_query", "args": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": null, "agent": "planner", "description": "Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.
