The Ganga is the longest river in India and is considered the holiest river, especially in northern India, with major efforts like the Namami Gange programme dedicated to keeping it clean. The Godavari, known as the \"Dakshina Ganga\" or \"Ganga of the South,\" is the second longest river in India and is highly revered in southern India. People gather at places like Nashik to take a dip in its holy waters, especially during events like the Godavari Pushkaram. Thus, while both rivers are sacred, the Ganga is more significant in the north, and the Godavari holds similar importance in the south.", "source_file": "D:\\llm\\completeSuite\\llm-compliance\\ragData\\eeev102.pdf", "contexts_count": 3, "metrics": {"context_precision": {"score": null, "threshold": 0.75, "passed": false, "error": "Metric returned None/NaN score"}, "answer_correctness": {"score": null, "threshold": 0.7, "passed": false, "error": "Metric returned None/NaN score"}, "context_entity_recall": {"score": null, "threshold": 0.6, "passed": false, "error": "Metric returned None/NaN score"}, "context_recall": {"score": null, "threshold": 0.7, "passed": false, "error": "Metric returned None/NaN score"}, "answer_relevancy": {"score": null, "threshold": 0.7, "passed": false, "error": "Metric returned None/NaN score"}, "faithfulness": {"score": null, "threshold": 0.85, "passed": false, "error": "Metric returned None/NaN score"}}, "errors": ["context_precision returned None/NaN score for case_1", "answer_correctness returned None/NaN score for case_1", "context_entity_recall returned None/NaN score for case_1", "context_recall returned None/NaN score for case_1", "answer_relevancy returned None/NaN score for case_1", "faithfulness returned None/NaN score for case_1"]}

The Godavari is a perennial river, meaning it flows all year round, unlike seasonal rivers that flow only during the rainy season.\n\nCulturally, the Godavari is called Dakshina Ganga and is considered sacred, with many stories from the Ramayana and Puranas. Festivals like the Godavari Pushkaram attract people to its banks, especially in places like Nashik, to take a dip in its holy waters.\n\nEcologically, the river supports rich forests and diverse wildlife, including tigers, barking deer, the Indian golden gecko, and red sandalwood trees.
