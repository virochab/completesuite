Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released in 1991. Its name is inspired by the British comedy show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it versatile for various types of projects. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management.\n\nThe language's syntax emphasizes clarity and simplicity, primarily achieved through significant indentation, which enhances code readability. Python comes with a broad standard library that facilitates rapid development and supports a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing and machine learning.\n\nOver the years, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major transition occurred with Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14 providing new features, improved performance, and ongoing security support.\n\nPython has gained widespread popularity, especially in the machine learning community, and has consistently ranked among the top programming languages globally. Its ease of learning and extensive ecosystem make it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. As of 2025, the Python Software Foundation actively supports the latest versions, ensuring ongoing updates and security patches.", "tools_called": [{"name": "wikipedia_query", "args": {"query": "Tell me about Python programming language"}, "id": null, "agent": "planner", "description": "Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.\n\nAI encompasses a wide range of applications, such as advanced web search engines (like Google Search), recommendation systems (used by platforms like YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), virtual assistants (such as Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa), autonomous vehicles (like Waymo), and generative tools that create content, including language models and AI-generated art. Many AI applications have become so integrated into daily life that they are often not labeled explicitly as AI.\n\nThe field has various subfields with specific goals, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, perception, and reasoning. Researchers employ diverse techniques like neural networks, formal logic, optimization, and statistical methods, often drawing insights from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy.\n\nA significant pursuit within AI is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems capable of understanding, learning, and performing any cognitive task that a human can do, often with proficiency equal to or surpassing human abilities. Beyond AGI, the concept of artificial superintelligence (ASI) describes AI that exceeds human intelligence across all domains by a wide margin.\n\nThe history of AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, but recent advances\u2014particularly since 2012 with deep learning and transformer architectures\u2014have led to rapid progress, especially in generative AI.
