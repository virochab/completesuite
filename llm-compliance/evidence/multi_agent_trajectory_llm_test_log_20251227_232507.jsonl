Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with features such as exception handling and system interfacing. Its name was inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it a versatile language suitable for various applications. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management for developers.\n\nThroughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major, backward-incompatible Python 3.0 was launched in 2008, marking a significant shift in the language's development. Since then, the Python community has transitioned towards Python 3.x versions, with the latest stable release being Python 3.14.0 as of October 2025. Support for earlier versions like Python 2.7 ended in 2020.\n\nPython's broad standard library and ease of use have contributed to its widespread adoption. It is particularly popular in the machine learning community and is commonly used as an introductory programming language in education. The language consistently ranks among the top ten most popular programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index, which measures popularity based on search activity across multiple platforms.\n\nIn summary, Python is a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly programming language with a rich history and a vibrant community, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers across various domains.", "tools_called": [{"name": "wikipedia_query", "args": "Python programming language", "id": null, "agent": "planner", "description": "Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.
