It is considered the holiest river in India, with numerous religious festivals, rituals, and beliefs associated with it.\n\n**Regional Significance:**\n- The Godavari is the second-longest river in India, flowing about 1,465 kilometers from the Western Ghats at Trimbakeshwar in Maharashtra to the Bay of Bengal. It passes through rich forests and supports various wildlife and human settlements, making it vital for agriculture, water supply, and cultural practices in southern India.\n- The Ganga flows through northern India and is central to many cultural, religious, and economic activities in that region.
