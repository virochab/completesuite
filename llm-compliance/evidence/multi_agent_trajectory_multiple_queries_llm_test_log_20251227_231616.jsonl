Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released in 1991. Its name is inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it versatile for various types of projects. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management for developers.\n\nThroughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions, Unicode support, and a cycle-detecting garbage collector. The major release Python 3.0 came in 2008, featuring many backward-incompatible changes to improve the language's consistency and clarity. Since then, Python 3 has continued to evolve, with versions like 3.5 introducing optional static typing capabilities.\n\nPython's broad standard library and ease of use have contributed to its widespread adoption. It is particularly popular in the machine learning community and is often used as an introductory programming language in education. As of 2025, the Python Software Foundation supports multiple recent versions, including 3.10 through 3.14, with the latest stable release being Python 3.14.0. Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life, with support primarily focused on security updates.\n\nPython's popularity is reflected in its consistent ranking among the top ten most popular programming languages worldwide, according to the TIOBE Index, which measures language popularity based on search activity across various platforms.", "tools_called": [{"name": "wikipedia_query", "args": {"topic": "Python (programming language)"}, "id": null, "agent": "planner", "description": "Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.
