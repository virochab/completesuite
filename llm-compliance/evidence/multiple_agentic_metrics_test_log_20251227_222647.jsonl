Developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes clear and concise code through features like significant indentation and a broad standard library. Its design supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n\nPython's history includes major releases such as Python 2.0 in 2000, which introduced features like list comprehensions and Unicode support, and Python 3.0 in 2008, a significant, backward-incompatible update that improved the language's consistency and capabilities. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14 supporting advanced features such as optional static typing, which was added starting with Python 3.5.\n\nThe language is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, enhancing developer productivity and ease of use. Python's community-driven development process and its support from the Python Software Foundation have contributed to its widespread adoption. It is particularly popular in the machine learning community and is frequently used as an introductory programming language.\n\nAs of 2025, the latest stable release is Python 3.14.0, which continues to receive bug fixes and security updates. Earlier versions, such as Python 2.x, have reached end-of-life, with support officially ending in 2020.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.\n\nAI encompasses a wide range of applications and subfields. High-profile examples include advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, and generative tools for creating art and language content. Many AI applications have become so integrated into daily life that they are often not labeled explicitly as AI once they become commonplace.\n\nThe research and development of AI involve various techniques, including neural networks, formal logic, search algorithms, statistical methods, and insights from fields like psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy. The ultimate goals of AI research include creating systems capable of general intelligence\u2014known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\u2014which can perform any cognitive task a human can do, and potentially surpass human abilities, leading to concepts like artificial superintelligence (ASI).\n\nSince its inception in 1956, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, with significant growth occurring after 2012 due to advancements in neural networks and deep learning, especially with the development of transformer architectures. Today, the ongoing AI boom is characterized by rapid progress in generative AI, which can create and modify content, raising both opportunities and ethical concerns about its long-term impacts and safety.\n\nIn summary, AI is a broad and dynamic field dedicated to developing machines that can mimic and surpass human intelligence across various domains, with ongoing efforts to achieve more generalized and autonomous forms of artificial intelligence.", "tools_called": [{"name": "wikipedia_query", "args": {"query": "What is artificial intelligence?"}, "id": null, "agent": "planner", "description": "Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.
