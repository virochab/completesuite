Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and developer productivity.\n\n\n\nPage: History of Python\nSummary: The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum was Python's principal author and had a central role in deciding the direction of Python (as reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)) until stepping down as leader on July 12, 2018. Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\nPython 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collector, reference counting, memory management and support for Unicode, along with a change to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.\nPython 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features were also backported to the backwards-compatible Python versions 2.6 and 2.7 until support for Python 2 finally ceased at the beginning of 2020. Releases of Python 3 up through 3.12 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.\nAs of 24 October 2025, Python 3.14.0 is the latest stable release. This version currently receives full bug-fix and security updates, while Python 3.13\u2014released in October 2024\u2014will continue to receive bug-fixes until October 2026, and after that will only receive security fixes until its end-of-life in 2029. Python 3.10 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase)."], "answer": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language renowned for its emphasis on code readability and developer productivity.

The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n\n\n\nPage: Artificial general intelligence\nSummary: Artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014sometimes called human\u2011level AI\u2014is a type of artificial intelligence that would match or surpass human capabilities across virtually all cognitive tasks.\nBeyond AGI, artificial superintelligence (ASI) would outperform the best human abilities across every domain by a wide margin. Unlike artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), whose competence is confined to well\u2011defined tasks, an AGI system can generalise knowledge, transfer skills between domains, and solve novel problems without task\u2011specific reprogramming. The concept does not, in principle, require the system to be an autonomous agent; a static model\u2014such as a highly capable large language model\u2014or an embodied robot could both satisfy the definition so long as human\u2011level breadth and proficiency are achieved.\nCreating AGI is a stated goal of AI technology companies such as OpenAI, Google, xAI, and Meta.
