Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language and named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a broad range of applications. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management.\n\nThe language's syntax is clean and readable, primarily using significant indentation to define code blocks, which encourages clear and maintainable code. Python's extensive standard library and broad ecosystem have contributed to its popularity across various fields, especially in machine learning, data analysis, web development, and automation.\n\nThroughout its development, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 with new features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. A major, backward-incompatible update, Python 3.0, was released in 2008, introducing many improvements and new features, including optional static typing capabilities starting from Python 3.5.\n\nAs of 2025, the Python Software Foundation supports Python versions 3.10 through 3.14, with the latest stable release being Python 3.14.0.
