Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with features like exception handling and system interfacing. Its name was inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it versatile for various types of projects. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, which means that type checking is done at runtime, and code is executed directly without prior compilation. Python's syntax uses significant indentation, which enhances code readability.\n\nThroughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions, Unicode support, and a cycle-detecting garbage collector. The major overhaul came with Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14 offering new capabilities and improvements.\n\nPython has a broad standard library and a large community, which has contributed to its widespread adoption. It is particularly popular in the machine learning community and is widely used as an introductory programming language in education. As of 2025, Python remains one of the most popular programming languages, consistently ranking in the top ten in the TIOBE Programming Community Index.\n\nThe Python Software Foundation supports ongoing development, with the latest stable release being Python 3.14.0 as of October 2025.
