Its name is inspired by the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a broad range of applications. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management for developers.\n\nThroughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major overhaul came with Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14, released between 2020 and 2025, offering enhanced features such as optional static typing and improved performance.\n\nPython's broad standard library and ease of learning have contributed to its popularity, especially in the machine learning community and as an introductory programming language. It consistently ranks among the top programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index, which measures popularity based on search activity across multiple platforms.\n\nIn summary, Python is a powerful, readable, and flexible programming language with a rich history and active development community, making it a preferred choice for developers across various domains.", "tools_called": [{"name": "wikipedia_query", "args": "Python (programming language)", "id": null, "agent": "planner", "description": "Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.
