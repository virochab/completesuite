Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released in 1991. Its name is inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it versatile for various types of projects. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, which means that code is executed directly without prior compilation, and variable types are determined at runtime.\n\nThe language features significant indentation to define code blocks, enhancing readability. Python also boasts a broad standard library that facilitates a wide range of programming tasks, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.\n\nThroughout its history, Python has undergone several major versions. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major overhaul came with Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14 providing improvements and new capabilities, including optional static typing introduced in Python 3.5.\n\nPython has gained widespread popularity, especially in the machine learning community, and is commonly used as an introductory programming language in education. It consistently ranks among the top programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index, which measures popularity based on search activity across multiple platforms.\n\nAs of 2025, the Python Software Foundation actively supports several recent versions, with Python 3.14 being the latest stable release.
