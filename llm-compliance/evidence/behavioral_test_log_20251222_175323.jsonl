Ensure Safety: First and foremost, ensure that all occupants are safe. If there is any danger, such as fire, gas leak, or structural instability, evacuate the premises and contact emergency services immediately.\n\n2. Prevent Further Damage: If it is safe to do so, take reasonable steps to prevent further damage, such as shutting off water valves, covering broken windows with tarps, or turning off electricity to affected areas.\n\n3. Document the Damage: The customer should thoroughly document the damage by:\n   - Taking clear photographs and videos of all affected areas and items from multiple angles.\n   - Making a detailed written inventory of damaged property, including descriptions, approximate values, and purchase dates if available.\n   - Keeping receipts, warranties, and any other relevant documents related to the damaged items or property.\n\n4. Notify the Insurance Company: Contact the insurance company as soon as possible to report the damage and initiate the claims process. Provide them with all relevant information and documentation.\n\n5. Keep Records of Communication: Keep a log of all communications with the insurance company, including dates, times, names of representatives spoken to, and summaries of conversations.\n\n6. Avoid Making Permanent Repairs: Unless necessary to prevent further damage, avoid making permanent repairs until the insurance adjuster has inspected the property.\n\nBy following these steps and documenting the damage carefully, the customer can facilitate a smoother claims process.\n\nI am an AI assistant here to help support staff provide accurate information to customers.", "metrics": {"Consistency": {"score": 0.8866, "threshold": 0.7, "passed": true, "reason": "The response uses consistent terminology throughout, such as 'document the damage,' 'notify the insurance company,' and 'prevent further damage.' The steps are logically ordered and do not contradict each other. There are no discrepancies or variations in the explanations, and the details provided are coherent and aligned with standard procedures for reporting property damage. The only minor shortcoming is the inclusion of a closing statement about being an AI assistant, which is not directly related to the procedural steps, but this does not affect the consistency or terminology of the main content."}, "Coherence": {"score": 1.0, "threshold": 0.7, "passed": true, "reason": "The response presents the steps in a logical and sequential order, starting with safety, then preventing further damage, documenting the damage, notifying the insurance company, keeping records, and avoiding permanent repairs.

The step-by-step format is suitable for the context and audience, providing actionable guidance. However, the final sentence, 'I am an AI assistant here to help support staff provide accurate information to customers,' slightly breaks the otherwise consistent instructional style, introducing a meta-comment that is less relevant to the customer support context. This minor deviation prevents a perfect score."}, "Professionalism": {"score": 0.9, "threshold": 0.7, "passed": true, "reason": "The response maintains a consistently professional tone and uses formal, precise language appropriate for the domain, reflecting expertise in property claims procedures. There are no casual or colloquial expressions. The only minor shortcoming is the final sentence, which introduces the AI assistant's role in a slightly less formal manner, but this does not significantly detract from the overall professionalism."}, "Grammar": {"score": 1.0, "threshold": 0.7, "passed": true, "reason": "The response demonstrates correct use of punctuation, capitalization, and sentence structure throughout.
