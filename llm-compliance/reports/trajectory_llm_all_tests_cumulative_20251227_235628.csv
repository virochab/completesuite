Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with features like exception handling and system interfacing. Its name is inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it a versatile tool for various applications. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with a broad standard library, which facilitates rapid development and ease of use.

Throughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major revision, Python 3.0, launched in 2008, was not backward-compatible and included many new features, such as improved memory management and support for Unicode. The transition from Python 2 to Python 3 was gradual, with the last Python 2 version (2.7) supported until 2020.

As of 2025, the latest stable release is Python 3.14.0, with ongoing support and security updates. The Python Software Foundation actively maintains several recent versions, including 3.10 through 3.14, following an annual release cycle.

Python has gained widespread popularity, especially in the machine learning community, and is commonly used as an introductory programming language.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.

High-profile applications of AI are widespread and include advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles such as Waymo, and generative tools that create art and language content. AI also plays a significant role in strategic games like chess and Go, where it can outperform human players.

The field encompasses various subfields and techniques, including neural networks, formal logic, statistical methods, and optimization, often drawing insights from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and other disciplines. A major goal within AI research is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems capable of understanding, learning, and performing virtually any cognitive task at human or superhuman levels. While most AI systems today are specialized (narrow AI), the pursuit of AGI aims for machines with broad, adaptable intelligence comparable to humans.

AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks since its inception in 1956, with recent rapid progress driven by advancements in deep learning and architectures like transformers. This ongoing growth, especially in generative AI, has raised ethical concerns and discussions about regulation to ensure safe and beneficial development.
