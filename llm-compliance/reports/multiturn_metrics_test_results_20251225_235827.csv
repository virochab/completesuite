case_1,"A science teacher leads students in comparing how sugar and oil behave in water, then guides a discussion contrasting the effects of dissolvable pollutants (like chemicals) versus non-dissolvable waste (like oil) on river health, animal life, and water safety.","Students understand the difference between substances that dissolve in water and those that do not, and learn how both types of pollutants can harm river ecosystems and affect water safety for animals and people.","Student studying science, geography, and environmental studies in class",2,,2025-12-25T23:58:27.539505,gpt-4o,True,1.0,0.7,gpt-4o,False,0,0.7,gpt-4o,False,0.0,0.7,gpt-4o,True,1.0,0.7
case_2,"After making a list of household waste, two siblings conduct a sugar-and-oil water experiment, then discuss with their parent how waste, chemicals, and fertilizers—some dissolving, some not—can make river water look deceptively clean, harm plants and animals, cause green blankets of growth, and threaten the safety of people using the river.","The siblings understand that different types of waste and chemicals, whether they dissolve in water or not, can harm river ecosystems and people, even if the water appears clean.","Student studying science, geography, and environmental studies in class",4,,2025-12-25T23:58:41.579577,gpt-4o,True,1.0,0.7,gpt-4o,False,0,0.7,gpt-4o,False,0.0,0.7,gpt-4o,True,1.0,0.7
