Journey of a River
There are fascinating stories about me, many 
from the Ramayana and the Puranas. I am called 
Dakshina Ganga because I flow through southern 
India and am regarded as sacred.
In places like Nashik, near where I begin, people 
come from all around to take a dip in my holy 
waters, especially during events like the Godavari 
Pushkaram.
India has built its longest river bridge, the Bhupen Hazarika Setu, over the 
Brahmaputra River. It is more than 9 kilometres long!

Where I Begin, Where I Flow
I have no feet, but I travel far, 
Through fields and forests, under moon and star.
I quench your thirst and help plants grow,
From mountain to sea, I quietly flow.
Who am I? 
Yes! I am a river.
I am Godavari. My journey begins high up in the 
Western Ghats at Trimbakeshwar in Maharashtra.
Although I start out as a stream, as I move  
across the land, rainwater and other streams join 
me, making me wider and stronger. The small 
streams joining are",1.0,0.85,True,0.9138,0.7,True,0.5,0.75,False,1.0,0.7,True,0.8667,0.6,True,1.0,0.7,True,False,5,6,83.33,,2025-12-29T20:40:55.418292
