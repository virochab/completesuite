1. **Lack of Clarity and Accessibility:** The responses, while informative, did not simplify the technical concepts for students, which is a key aspect of the role. For instance, terms like 'habitat loss' and 'conservation efforts' were mentioned without further explanation or simplification for a student audience (turn #2).

2. **Inadequate Citation:** Although the responses cited a source (eeev102.pdf), they did not provide a clear reference or explanation of the source's credibility or relevance, which is crucial for educational purposes (turn #2, #4).

3. **Tone and Engagement:** The responses lacked an engaging and encouraging tone that would invite students to explore the topic further. The role requires maintaining a helpful and educational tone, which was not evident in the responses (turn #2, #4).
