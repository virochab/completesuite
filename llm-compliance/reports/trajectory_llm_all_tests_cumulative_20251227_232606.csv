Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with features such as exception handling and system interfacing. Its name was inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it a versatile language suitable for various applications. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management for developers.

Throughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major, backward-incompatible Python 3.0 was launched in 2008, marking a significant shift in the language's development. Since then, the Python community has transitioned towards Python 3.x versions, with the latest stable release being Python 3.14.0 as of October 2025. Support for earlier versions like Python 2.7 ended in 2020.

Python's broad standard library and ease of use have contributed to its widespread adoption. It is particularly popular in the machine learning community and is commonly used as an introductory programming language in education. The language consistently ranks among the top ten most popular programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index, which measures popularity based on search activity across multiple platforms.

In summary, Python is a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly programming language with a rich history and a vibrant community, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers across various domains.",f093e032-4232-494f-b932-3b18af48e6e5,2025-12-27T23:25:15.146139,"[{""name"": ""wikipedia_query"", ""args"": ""Python programming language"", ""id"": null, ""agent"": ""planner"", ""description"": ""Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment and use various techniques—such as neural networks, logical reasoning, search algorithms, and statistical methods—to achieve specific goals effectively.

AI has a wide range of high-profile applications, including advanced search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms like YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, and generative tools that create content such as AI art and language models. Many AI applications have become so integrated into daily life that they are often not labeled explicitly as AI.

The field encompasses various subfields with specific goals, including natural language processing, robotics, perception, and knowledge representation. Researchers draw upon disciplines like psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy to advance AI capabilities.

A significant area of research within AI is the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems that can perform any cognitive task a human can do, with the ability to transfer knowledge across domains and solve novel problems. AGI aims to match or surpass human intelligence across virtually all tasks, and some companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta are actively working toward this goal. Beyond AGI, the concept of artificial superintelligence (ASI) describes systems that would outperform humans across all domains by a wide margin.

The history of AI includes periods of optimism and setbacks, with recent rapid progress driven by advancements in deep learning, neural networks, and architectures like transformers. The ongoing AI boom has led to significant technological developments but also raises ethical concerns regarding safety, long-term impacts, and potential existential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI systems.",b4383e31-4d8b-43f8-88a8-2c71f888663d,2025-12-27T23:25:45.795860,"[{""name"": ""wikipedia_query"", ""args"": ""Artificial Intelligence"", ""id"": null, ""agent"": ""planner"", ""description"": ""Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.
