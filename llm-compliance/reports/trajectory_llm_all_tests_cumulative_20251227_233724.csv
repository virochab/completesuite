Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with features such as exception handling and system interfacing. Its name is inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it versatile for various types of projects. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management. Its syntax emphasizes clarity and simplicity, often using significant indentation to define code blocks.

Throughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major overhaul came with Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions but brought many improvements. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14 providing enhanced capabilities, including optional static typing introduced in Python 3.5.

Python has gained widespread popularity, especially in the machine learning community, and is commonly used as an introductory programming language in education. It consistently ranks among the top programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index. The Python Software Foundation actively supports the language's development, with the latest stable release being Python 3.14.0 as of October 2025. Support for older versions like Python 2 has ended, with Python 3 now the standard for ongoing development and security updates.",346a2978-582b-40d4-838b-e6a8f12b2176,2025-12-27T23:36:30.429277,"[{""name"": ""wikipedia_query"", ""args"": {""topic"": ""Python programming language""}, ""id"": null, ""agent"": ""planner"", ""description"": ""Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.

High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles such as Waymo, and generative tools that create content like AI art and language models. AI is also used in strategic games, where it can outperform humans in chess and Go.

The field encompasses various subfields and techniques, including neural networks, formal logic, search algorithms, statistical methods, and insights from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy. A major goal within AI research is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which would possess human-level cognitive abilities across virtually all tasks, and potentially artificial superintelligence (ASI), which would outperform humans in every domain.

AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks since its inception in 1956, with recent rapid progress driven by advances in deep learning, neural networks, and architectures like transformers. This ongoing growth has led to what is known as the AI boom in the 2020s, raising both exciting possibilities and ethical concerns about safety, long-term impacts, and societal effects.",436eab86-7e99-45b1-a5a9-66d46f004912,2025-12-27T23:37:01.413326,"[{""name"": ""wikipedia_query"", ""args"": {""query"": ""artificial intelligence""}, ""id"": null, ""agent"": ""planner"", ""description"": ""Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.

Paris, often called ""The City of Light,"" has a rich history dating back over 2,000 years. Originally a small Gallic settlement called Lutetia during Roman times, it grew into a major center of trade, culture, and politics in medieval France. The city became the capital of France in the 10th century and has since been a hub for art, philosophy, and revolution. Notable historical landmarks include the Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Louvre Museum, and the Eiffel Tower. Paris has played a pivotal role in events such as the French Revolution and has been a global center for fashion, art, and intellectual thought throughout the centuries.
