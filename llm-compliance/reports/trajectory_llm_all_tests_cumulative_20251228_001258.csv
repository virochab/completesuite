Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with features such as exception handling and system interfacing. Its name is inspired by the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a broad range of applications. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management for developers.

Throughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major overhaul came with Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14, released between 2020 and 2025, offering enhanced features such as optional static typing and improved performance.

Python's broad standard library and ease of learning have contributed to its popularity, especially in the machine learning community and as an introductory programming language. It consistently ranks among the top programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index, which measures popularity based on search activity across multiple platforms.

In summary, Python is a powerful, readable, and flexible programming language with a rich history and active development community, making it a preferred choice for developers across various domains.",a570fa39-194c-4441-bda3-37c3f9fa46aa,2025-12-28T00:12:03.720892,"[{""name"": ""wikipedia_query"", ""args"": ""Python (programming language)"", ""id"": null, ""agent"": ""planner"", ""description"": ""Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.

High-profile applications of AI are widespread and include advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles such as Waymo, and generative tools that create content like AI art and language models. AI is also used in strategic games, where it can outperform humans in chess and Go.

The field encompasses various subfields and techniques, including neural networks, formal logic, search algorithms, and statistical methods, often drawing insights from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy. A key goal of AI research is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which would possess human-level cognitive abilities across virtually all tasks, and potentially, artificial superintelligence (ASI), which would surpass human capabilities in every domain.

Since its inception in 1956, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, but recent advances—particularly since 2012 with the advent of deep learning and transformer architectures—have led to rapid progress, especially in generative AI. This growth has raised ethical concerns and discussions about regulation to ensure safe and beneficial development of AI technologies.

Paris, the capital of France, has a rich history dating back over 2,000 years. Originally a small Gallic settlement called Lutetia during Roman times, it grew into a major city in medieval Europe. Paris became a center of art, culture, and politics, especially during the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods. It played a pivotal role in historical events such as the French Revolution in 1789. Today, Paris is renowned worldwide for its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral, as well as its influence on fashion, art, and culture.
