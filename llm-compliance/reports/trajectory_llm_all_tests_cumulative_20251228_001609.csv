Developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes clear and concise code through its use of significant indentation and a syntax designed to be easy to read and write. Its design supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed directly without prior compilation, which enhances developer productivity and ease of use. It features dynamic typing, allowing variables to change types during execution, and includes automatic garbage collection for efficient memory management. The language boasts a comprehensive standard library that provides numerous modules and tools to facilitate various programming tasks.

Throughout its history, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major transition to Python 3.0 in 2008 brought substantial changes, including backward incompatibility, to improve the language's consistency and capabilities. Since then, newer versions such as Python 3.5 and beyond have added features like optional static typing, enhancing code robustness and maintainability.

Python has gained widespread popularity, especially in the machine learning community, and is commonly used as an introductory programming language in education. It consistently ranks among the top programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index. As of 2025, the latest stable release is Python 3.14.0, with ongoing support and security updates for recent versions like 3.10 through 3.14. The language's development is managed by the Python Software Foundation, which follows an annual release cycle and a five-year support policy.",c1f50af4-807d-4953-b537-052b0de9723f,2025-12-28T00:15:14.023063,"[{""name"": ""wikipedia_query"", ""args"": {""topic"": ""Python programming language""}, ""id"": null, ""agent"": ""planner"", ""description"": ""Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.

High-profile applications of AI are widespread and include advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, and generative tools for creating content such as language models and AI art. AI also plays a significant role in strategic games, surpassing human performance in chess and Go.

The field encompasses various subfields and techniques, including neural networks, formal logic, search algorithms, statistical methods, and insights from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy. The ultimate goals of AI research include developing artificial general intelligence (AGI)—systems capable of performing any cognitive task a human can do—and, potentially, artificial superintelligence (ASI), which would outperform humans across all domains.

Since its inception in 1956, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, known as AI winters. Significant progress has been made since 2012, especially with the advent of deep learning and transformer architectures, leading to the current rapid growth phase known as the AI boom. While AI offers many benefits, it also raises ethical concerns, including potential harms and existential risks, prompting discussions about regulation and safety.

","Based on the current weather data, in Paris, the weather is clear with very low cloud cover (about 3%), a gentle breeze with wind speeds around 2.57 m/s coming from the east-northeast (70°), and high humidity at 91%. The temperature is approximately -0.69°C, feeling colder at around -3.91°C due to wind chill, with daytime highs reaching about 1.43°C and lows around -1.72°C. There is no rain currently.

**Regarding the weather on December 31st in Paris:**  
While I cannot provide a precise forecast for that specific future date, December in Paris typically features cold winter weather, often with temperatures ranging from around -2°C to 7°C, and a high likelihood of cloudy skies, occasional rain or snow, and chilly winds. Given the current cold conditions and high humidity, it’s reasonable to expect similar winter weather around December 31st.

**A brief history of Paris:**  
Paris, the capital of France, has a rich history dating back over 2,000 years. Originally founded as a small settlement by the Parisii tribe in the 3rd century BC, it grew into a major city during the Roman Empire. Throughout the Middle Ages, Paris became a center of learning, culture, and commerce, with iconic landmarks like Notre-Dame Cathedral emerging during this period. The city played a pivotal role during the French Revolution in the late 18th century, symbolizing liberty and change. Over the centuries, Paris has developed into a global hub for art, fashion, and politics, renowned for its historic architecture, museums, and vibrant cultural scene.
