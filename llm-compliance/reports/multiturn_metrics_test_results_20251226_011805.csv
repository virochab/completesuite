3. In turn #6, the response suggests specific water testing kits and methods, which again aligns more with a technical advisory role rather than a school assistant. The focus on 'pH Test Kits,' 'Turbidity Test Kits,' and 'Chemical Test Kits' is too specialized and not aligned with the educational support expected from a school assistant.
