AI has a wide range of high-profile applications, including advanced search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms like YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, and generative tools that create art or language content. Many AI applications are so integrated into daily life that they are often not labeled explicitly as AI.

The field encompasses several subfields with specific goals, including natural language processing, robotics, knowledge representation, and perception. Researchers also pursue the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems capable of performing virtually any cognitive task a human can do, and potentially surpassing human abilities across all domains. The pursuit of AGI is a significant focus for companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta.

Historically, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, known as AI winters. However, recent advances—particularly since 2012 with the rise of deep learning and neural networks—have led to rapid progress, especially in generative AI, which can create and modify content.

Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released in 1991. Its name is inspired by the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it versatile for various types of projects. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, which means that code is executed directly without prior compilation, and variable types are determined at runtime.

The language features significant indentation to define code blocks, enhancing readability. Python also boasts a broad standard library that facilitates a wide range of programming tasks, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.

Throughout its history, Python has undergone several major versions. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. The major overhaul came with Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible with earlier versions. Since then, the language has continued to evolve, with recent versions like Python 3.10 through 3.14 providing improvements and new capabilities, including optional static typing introduced in Python 3.5.

Python has gained widespread popularity, especially in the machine learning community, and is commonly used as an introductory programming language in education. It consistently ranks among the top programming languages globally, according to the TIOBE Index, which measures popularity based on search activity across multiple platforms.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, decision-making, and understanding natural language. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment, adapt, and take actions to achieve specific goals effectively.

High-profile applications of AI are widespread and include advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, autonomous vehicles such as Waymo, and generative tools that create content like AI art and language models. AI also plays a significant role in strategic games, surpassing human performance in chess and Go.

The field encompasses various subfields with specific goals, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, perception, and knowledge representation. Researchers utilize diverse techniques such as neural networks, formal logic, optimization, and statistical methods, often drawing insights from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy.

A major pursuit within AI is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems capable of performing any cognitive task that a human can do, with the ability to transfer knowledge across domains and solve novel problems. Some organizations, like OpenAI and Google DeepMind, aim to create AGI, which would surpass narrow AI applications that are limited to specific tasks.

Since its inception in 1956, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, but recent advancements—particularly after 2012 with deep learning and transformer architectures—have led to rapid progress, especially in generative AI. This boom has raised ethical concerns and discussions about regulation, given AI's potential long-term impacts and risks.

Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language and named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a broad range of applications. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language with automatic garbage collection, which simplifies memory management.

The language's syntax is clean and readable, primarily using significant indentation to define code blocks, which encourages clear and maintainable code. Python's extensive standard library and broad ecosystem have contributed to its popularity across various fields, especially in machine learning, data analysis, web development, and automation.

Throughout its development, Python has undergone significant updates. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 with new features like list comprehensions and Unicode support. A major, backward-incompatible update, Python 3.0, was released in 2008, introducing many improvements and new features, including optional static typing capabilities starting from Python 3.5.

As of 2025, the Python Software Foundation supports Python versions 3.10 through 3.14, with the latest stable release being Python 3.14.0. Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life, with support focusing on security updates.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to develop computational systems that can perceive their environment and use various techniques—such as neural networks, logical reasoning, optimization, and statistical methods—to achieve specific goals effectively.

AI has a wide range of high-profile applications, including advanced web search engines (like Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), virtual assistants (such as Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa), autonomous vehicles (like Waymo), and generative tools for creating content, including AI-generated art and language models. AI systems are also employed in strategic games, surpassing human performance in chess and Go.

The field encompasses various subfields with specific goals, such as natural language processing, robotics, knowledge representation, and perception. Some organizations, including OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta, are working toward creating artificial general intelligence (AGI)—a form of AI that can perform virtually any cognitive task at or above human levels. AGI differs from narrow AI, which is specialized for specific tasks, and from artificial superintelligence (ASI), which would outperform humans across all domains.

AI has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks throughout its history, with significant growth accelerating after 2012 due to advances in neural networks and deep learning, especially with the development of transformer architectures. Today, AI is rapidly advancing, particularly in generative AI, raising ethical concerns and discussions about regulation to ensure its safe and beneficial development.",fe84b6fa-3a79-4ab5-86aa-dedbb2120601,2025-12-27T23:05:45.612405,"[{""name"": ""wikipedia_query"", ""args"": {""query"": ""Artificial Intelligence""}, ""id"": null, ""agent"": ""planner"", ""description"": ""Searches Wikipedia for information about a given topic.
