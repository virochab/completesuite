case_1,How do the Godavari and Ganga rivers compare in terms of sacredness and regional significance?,Error connecting to RAG API: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: http://localhost:8000/query,"Both the Godavari and Ganga rivers are regarded as sacred in India, but they hold significance in different regions. The Ganga is the longest river in India and is considered the holiest river, especially in northern India, with major efforts like the Namami Gange programme dedicated to keeping it clean. The Godavari, known as the ""Dakshina Ganga"" or ""Ganga of the South,"" is the second longest river in India and is highly revered in southern India. People gather at places like Nashik to take a dip in its holy waters, especially during events like the Godavari Pushkaram. Thus, while both rivers are sacred, the Ganga is more significant in the north, and the Godavari holds similar importance in the south.",D:\llm\completeSuite\llm-compliance\ragData\eeev102.pdf,3,"23
Journey of a River
There are fascinating stories about me, many 
from the Ramayana and the Puranas. I am called 
Dakshina Ganga because I flow through southern 
India and am regarded as sacred.
In places like Nashik, near where I begin, people 
come from all around to take a dip in my holy 
waters, especially during events like the Godavari 
Pushkaram.
India has built its longest river bridge, the Bhupen Hazarika Setu, over the 
Brahmaputra River. It is more than 9 kilometres long!

Starting as a small stream, it is joined by rainwater and tributaries, becoming wider and stronger as it travels 1,465 kilometres to the Bay of Bengal. The Godavari is a perennial river, meaning it flows all year round, unlike seasonal rivers that flow only during the rainy season.

Culturally, the Godavari is called Dakshina Ganga and is considered sacred, with many stories from the Ramayana and Puranas. Festivals like the Godavari Pushkaram attract people to its banks, especially in places like Nashik, to take a dip in its holy waters.

Ecologically, the river supports rich forests and diverse wildlife, including tigers, barking deer, the Indian golden gecko, and red sandalwood trees. Its freshwater is vital for plants, animals, and people along its course. Efforts are being made to keep its water clean, highlighting its importance for both nature and communities.",D:\llm\completeSuite\llm-compliance\ragData\eeev102.pdf,3,"Journey of a River2

Through fields and forests, under moon and star.

Yes! I am a river.
I am Godavari. My journey begins high up in the
